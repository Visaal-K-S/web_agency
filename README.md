Hi guys this is my first responsive website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Have learnt a lot while doing this project, webpage design and colour combinations may not be good though
please bear that for me. It took 1.5 days to figure out and complete the project without any discrepancies. Images used in this project are free stock images and fontawesome icons are
to free though. As this being my first responsive website project if you find any discrepancies, please write to me in LinkedIn(www.linkedin.com/in/visaal-ks) I would like
to take your advice and build myself.
